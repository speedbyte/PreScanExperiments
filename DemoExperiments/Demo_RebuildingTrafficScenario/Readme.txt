% Follow the next steps to create your own experiment with the Demo_RebuildingTrafficScenario
% ================================================================================================================

Step 1.	Open the PreScan GUI and open the Demo_RebuildingTrafficScenario.pex file. Now 5 cars and 5 trajectorys
	are loaded with the three boxes and should be visible on the road.

Step 2. click on the Invoke Simulation Run Mode Button and Matlab will be opened.

Step 3. Check if Matlab opened the directory where the experiment was saved. Then open the simulink file
	Demo_RebuildingTrafficScenario_cs.mdl file using Matlab.

Step 4. Start the Simulink model and wait until the simulation is completely finished.

Step 5. Run the Matlab function "RebuildingTrafficScenario()" from this experiment directory. The results are saved in the Results directory, as a
	set of PNG files.

Step 6. (Optional) Use MovieGenerator to make a movie of the experiment
