% Follow the next steps to create your own experiment with the Demo_3DScatterPlot
% ================================================================================================================

Step 1.	Open the PreScan GUI and open the Demo_3DScatterPlot.pex file.

Step 2. click on the Invoke Simulation Run Mode Button and Matlab will be opened.

Step 3. Check if Matlab opened the directory where the experiment was saved. Then open the simulink file
	Demo_3DScatterPlot_cs.mdl file using Matlab.

Step 4. Start the Simulink model and wait until the simulation is completely finished.

Step 5. Type 'ScatterPlot3D(simout)' at the MATLAB command prompt. This command will run the Matlab script
        3DScatterPlot.m. The results are saved in the Results directory, as a set of PNG files.

Step 6. (Optional) Use MovieGenerator to make a movie of the experiment
