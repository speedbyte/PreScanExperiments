Step 1.	Open the PreScan GUI and open the Demo_TA.pex file.

Step 2. Click on the Invoke Simulation Run Mode Button and Matlab will be opened.

Step 3. Check if Matlab opened the directory where the experiment was saved.

Step 4. Then run Demo_TA_Runscript.m to start the simulation using Matlab.

Step 5. Note that 5 simulation runs are executed.

Step 6. After run 5 the results stored during each run are processed and plotted showing correlation values.
